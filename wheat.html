                <p class="crs-text">Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain that is a worldwide
                    staple food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum
                    the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). The archaeological record suggests that wheat
                    was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat
                    kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.

                    Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares or 545 million
                    acres, 2014). World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.

                    In 2020, world production of wheat was 761 million tonnes (839 million short tons; 1.7 trillion
                    pounds), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.[8] Since 1960, world production of
                    wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the
                    21st century. Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive
                    properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption
                    is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the
                    diet.Cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of wild grasses led to the
                    creation of domestic strains, as mutant forms ('sports') of wheat were preferentially chosen by
                    farmers. In domesticated wheat, grains are larger, and the seeds (inside the spikelets) remain
                    attached to the ear by a toughened rachis during harvesting
